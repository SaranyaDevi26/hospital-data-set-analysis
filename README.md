# hospital-data-set-analysis

In this phase of our hospital data project, I am taking a deeper dive into the analysis using Python and some popular libraries like NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn. With these tools, I will uncover more valuable insights and explore the data from different angles to gain a comprehensive understanding.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Conducted EDA by generating pair plots on the Readmission Registry table to visually explore relationships and uncover correlations between various column values.

In-Depth ICU Analysis: Leveraged Python to conduct a comprehensive analysis of the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) length of stay and mortality rates within the hospital, shedding light on critical patient care outcomes.

Age Group Stratification: Employed Python functions to define and assign patients into distinct age groups, enabling the exploration of correlations between age, primary diagnosis, and expected mortality, which provided valuable insights into age-related healthcare trends.

Patient Demographic: Explored patient demographics to uncover valuable insights, including age and gender trends, providing a comprehensive overview of the hospital's patient population and their healthcare needs.

Missing Data Identification: Utilized Python to identify and address missing values, particularly in columns related to blood pressure, ensuring data accuracy and completeness.

Interactive Visualization: Developed interactive and informative data visualizations, including bar charts, line graphs, scatter plots, and heatmaps, to visually convey critical insights and enhance data-driven decision-making in the hospital setting. These visualizations were carefully formatted and tailored to effectively communicate key findings.

After completing these analyses, I compiled all the findings and code on a GitHub repository. You can explore the detailed analysis and code in my GitHub repository.
